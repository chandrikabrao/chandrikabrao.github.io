abstract = "A series of novel 2-amino-4-pyrazolecyclopentylpyrimidines have been prepared and evaluated as IGF-1R tyrosin kinase inhibitors. The in vitro activity was found to depend strongly on the substitution pattern in the 2- amino ring, 4-pyrazolo moieties and size of fused saturated ring with the central pyrimidine core. A stepwise optimization by combination of active fragments led to discovery of compound 6f and 6k, two structures with IGF-1R IC50 of 20 nM and 10 nM, respectively. 6f was further profiled for its anti cancer activity across various cell lines and pharmacokinetic studies in Sprague Dawley rats."
