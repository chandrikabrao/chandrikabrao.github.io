Contrary to popular belief, recent clinical trials with uricosurics have demonstrated that enhanced excretion of uric acid is, by itself, not adequate to treat hyperuricemia; simultaneous inhibition of production of uric acid by inhibition of xanthine oxidase is also important. Virtual screening of in-house synthetic library followed by in vitro and in vivo testing led to the identification of a novel scaffold for xanthine oxidase inhibition. In vitro activity results corroborated the results from molecular docking studies of the virtual screening hits. The isocytosine scaffold maintains key hydrogen bonding and pi-stacking interactions in the deep end of the xanthine-binding pocket, which anchors it in an appropriate pose to inhibit binding of xanthine and shows promise for further lead optimization using structure-based drug design approach.","tags":[],"title":"Identification of novel isocytosine derivatives as xanthine oxidase inhibitors

promising therapeutic approach to diminish pathological inflammation is to inhibit the synthesis and/or biological activity of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Prior studies have shown that intraperitoneal administration of small-molecule inhibitors targeting the catalytic pocket of MIF (e.g., ISO-1) elicits a therapeutic effect in mouse inflammation models. However, it remains to be elucidated whether these tautomerase activity inhibitors block the synthesis and/or biological activity of MIF. In this study, we investigated and compared the activity of representative MIF inhibitors from isoxazole series (fluorinated analog of ISO-1; ISO-F) and substituted quinoline series (compound 7E; 7E). Our results demonstrate that ISO-F is a more potent MIF inhibitor than 7E. Both ISO-F and 7E do not inhibit MIF synthesis but \"bind-onto\" MIF thereby blocking its recognition. However, in contrast to 7E, ISO-F docks well in the active site of MIF and also has a stronger binding affinity towards MIF. In line with these observations, ISO-F, but not 7E, robustly inhibits the biological function of MIF. Most importantly, ISO-F, when administered orally in a therapeutic regimen, significantly suppresses dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis. This study, which provides mechanistic insights into the anti-inflammatory efficacy of ISO-F, is the first documented report of in vivo anti-inflammatory efficacy of a MIF inhibitor upon oral administration. Moreover, the findings from this study reinforce the potential of catalytic site of MIF as a target for eliciting therapeutic effect in inflammatory disorders. Compounds (e.g., ISO-F) that block not only the recognition but also the biological function of MIF are potentially attractive for reducing pathological inflammation.","tags":["MIF inhibition"],"title":"A fluorinated analog of ISO-1 blocks the recognition and biological function of MIF and is orally efficacious in a murine model of colitis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chandrika B-Rao","Jyothi Subramanian","Somesh D Sharma"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1238544000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609334353,"objectID":"7c2cc84d693f33f180c1f0ffb122e857","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/publication/managing-protein-flexibility-in-docking-and-its-applications/","publishdate":"2020-12-29T12:21:54+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/managing-protein-flexibility-in-docking-and-its-applications/","section":"publication","summary":"Docking, virtual screening and structure-based drug design are routinely used in modern drug discovery programs.

Even though numerous studies have stressed the importance of including protein flexibility in ligand docking, currently available methods provide only a partial solution to the problem. Most of these methods, being computer intensive, are often impractical to use in actual drug discovery settings. We had earlier shown that ligand‐induced receptor side‐chain conformational changes could be modeled statistically using data on known receptor–ligand complexes. In this paper, we show that a similar approach can be used to model more complex changes like backbone flips and loop movements. We have used p38 MAPK as a test case and have shown that a few simple structural features of ligands are sufficient to predict the induced variation in receptor conformations. Rigorous validation, both by internal resampling methods and on an external test set, corroborates this finding and demonstrates the robustness of the models. We have also compared our results with those from an earlier molecular dynamics simulation study on DFG loop conformations of p38 MAPK, and found that the results matched in the two cases. Our statistical approach enables one to predict the final ligand‐induced conformation of the active site of a protein, based on a few ligand properties, prior to docking the ligand. We can do this without having to trace the step‐by‐step process by which this state is arrived at (as in molecular dynamics simulations), thereby drastically reducing computational effort.","tags":["QSiCR - Quantitative Structure induced-Conformation Relationship"],"title":"Modeling and Selection of Flexible Proteins for Structure‐Based Drug Design: Backbone and Side Chain Movements in p38 MAPK","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chandrika B-Rao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1200268800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609250067,"objectID":"8fc2296c45497aac1c0c94a9616e9d2a","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/talk/practical-multivariate-statistical-analysis/","publishdate":"2020-12-29T13:32:40+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/practical-multivariate-statistical-analysis/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Practical Multivariate Statistical Analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Chandrika B-Rao","J Subramanian","S Sharma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1183248000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609250067,"objectID":"344e8f5f4ff14b9e30bd5aa2324e52c4","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/talk/predicting-ligand-induced-conformational-changes-in-proteins-for-structure-based-drug-design/","publishdate":"2020-12-29T14:15:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/predicting-ligand-induced-conformational-changes-in-proteins-for-structure-based-drug-design/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Predicting Ligand-Induced Conformational Changes in Proteins for Structure-Based Drug Design","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Chandrika B-Rao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1170979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609250067,"objectID":"29fa68fb160f09a066b6db2f6888c3d3","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/talk/predicting-ligand-induced-conformational-changes-in-proteins/","publishdate":"2020-12-29T13:31:03+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/predicting-ligand-induced-conformational-changes-in-proteins/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Predicting ligand-induced conformational changes in proteins","type":"talk"},{"authors":["S Gaan","J Subramanian","Chandrika B-Rao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1169337600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609250067,"objectID":"8e52ff044c9425721a691558e5069c30","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/talk/a-statistical-measure-of-drug-likeness/","publishdate":"2020-12-29T14:13:59+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/a-statistical-measure-of-drug-likeness/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A Statistical Measure of Drug-Likeness","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jyothi Subramanian","Somesh Sharma","Chandrika B-Rao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1157068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609334353,"objectID":"1ccba4f25c3dae27dd927f1873ca4bf4","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/publication/a-novel-computational-analysis-of-ligand-induced-conformational-changes-in-the-atp-binding-sites-of-cyclin-dependent-kinases/","publishdate":"2020-12-29T12:14:29+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/a-novel-computational-analysis-of-ligand-induced-conformational-changes-in-the-atp-binding-sites-of-cyclin-dependent-kinases/","section":"publication","summary":"Protein kinases in general are known to be very flexible macromolecules.

Linear models are developed to identify and quantify ligand properties that maximally influence the lysine side chain conformations. A few simple properties of the ligands are shown to account for more than 70% of the variation in the lysine conformations. The results are validated using test data and molecular simulation studies. Illustrative applications of the results of this analysis to finding the appropriate crystal structure for molecular docking and binding mode predictions of novel ligands are provided.

A missense mutation in MLC1 (putative cation-channel gene on 22q13) co-segregating with periodic catatonic schizophrenia has been reported. We have investigated the relationship of MLC1 with SCZ and BPAD in Southern India. Methods All exons and flanking intronic sequences of MLC1 were screened for novel variations. Case-control (216 BPAD, 193 SCZ, 116 control subjects) and family-based analyses (113 BPAD, 107 SCZ families) were performed to evaluate association of MLC1 with these disorders. Results We found 33 MLC1 sequence variations, including three novel mutations: Val210Ile, Leu308Gln, and Arg328His in six BPAD cases and Val210Ile in one control individual. Minor allele of a common variation, ss16339182 (in ∼6 Kb Linkage-Disequilibrium [LD]-block) was associated with BPAD in case-control ( p = .03) and family-based analyses (transmitted/nontransmitted [T/NT]-44/20; p = .003). Association was observed for rs2235349 and rs2076137 with SCZ and ss16339163 with BPAD in case-control study. Using Block 2 haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs), GC haplotype revealed association ( p = .02) and excess transmission ( p = .002) with BPAD. Conclusions Association of MLC1 with SCZ and BPAD suggests involvement of a common pathway. Rare missense mutations and common variants associated with BPAD favors hypothesis about likely involvement of both rare and common polymorphisms in etiology of this complex disorder.","tags":["Genetics of Neuropsychiatric disorders"],"title":"MLC1 Gene Is Associated with Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder in Southern India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ritushree Kukreti","Pallav Bhatnagar","Chandrika B-Rao","Simone Gupta","Babita Madan","Chinmoyee Das","Randeep Guleria","Amita Umesh Athavale","Samir Kumar Brahmachari","Balaram Ghosh"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1117584000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609250067,"objectID":"1fd3c6d0e510314a9571e317d972c5f8","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/publication/beta2-adrenergic-receptor-polymorphisms-and-response-to-salbutamol-among-indian-asthmatics/","publishdate":"2020-12-28T17:31:09+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/beta2-adrenergic-receptor-polymorphisms-and-response-to-salbutamol-among-indian-asthmatics/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction: The beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR or ADRbeta(2)) is the target for beta(2)-agonist drugs used for bronchodilation in asthma and other respiratory diseases. The aim of this study was to identify common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in asthmatics and healthy individuals from an Indian population, and determine the influence of beta(2)AR SNPs in responsiveness to beta(2)-agonist therapy in asthma patients.\nMethods: Ten variable SNP sites within a span of 2.193 kb were identified in the beta(2)AR gene by sequencing and genotyping 374 bronchial asthma patients and healthy individuals from an Indian population. Spirometry tests were performed on 80 unrelated patients before and after administration of 200 microg of salbutamol.

The SNPs were found to be organized into 16 haplotypes in the studied population. We found that patients with a homozygous Arg-16 form at nucleotide position 46 are poor responders with probability of 0.81, and patients with a homozygous Gly-16 form are good responders with a probability of 0.73. The responder status to salbutamol treatment and the genotype at nucleotide position 46 in beta(2)AR gene of an asthmatic patient are significantly associated in the studied Indian population (chi2=9.98, df=2, p=0.0068). Most importantly, this association for responsiveness to salbutamol at nucleotide position 46 is independent of other SNPs in the beta(2)AR gene.\nConclusion: This study suggests that the SNP at nucleotide position 46 has particular relevance to pharmacogenetics in the Indian population studied.","tags":["Pharmacogenetics of response to salbutamol"],"title":"β2-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms and response to salbutamol among Indian asthmatics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kamalpreet Nagpal","Shilpy Sharma","Chandrika B-Rao","Sanober Nahid","Pramod V Niphadkar","Surendra K Sharma","Balaram Ghosh"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1109635200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1109635200,"objectID":"b52f9321aa73e5e463fa9ea5aef35eb1","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/publication/tgf%CE%B21-haplotypes-and-asthma-in-indian-populations/","publishdate":"2020-12-28T17:21:36+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tgf%CE%B21-haplotypes-and-asthma-in-indian-populations/","section":"publication","summary":"Background Asthma is a complex disorder of the airways of the lungs.

These differences are measured by a “genetic distance” between the two populations (not to be confused with genetic distance between two loci, which is based on recombination fractions) and they play a major role in inferences at the population level. Several measures of genetic distance have been proposed by different authors (Sanghvi 1953; Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards 1967; Jukes and Cantor 1969; Nei 1972; Kimura 1980; Reynoldset al 1983; reviews in Felsenstein 1991; Nei and Kumar 2000). Most of these measures are actually dissimilarity measures and not mathematically true distance measures (B-Rao and Majumdar 1999). Independently, and much before the geneticists, statisticians too were concerned with the idea of distinguishing between two (statistical) populations. In order to discriminate between two populations on the basis of one or more characters, divergence measures like “Mahalanobis’D 2 statistic” or “Mahalanobis’ generalized distance” (1936) and “Bhattacharyya’s distance” (1943, 1946), Kullback-Leibler’s divergence measure (1951) etc. have been proposed by statisticians. Mukherjee and Chattopadhyaya (1986) have mentioned measures based on distances, association between two attributes and discrimination function. There are similarities between the distance measures defined by applied scientists and by theoreticians. Felsenstein (1985) shows that three of the allele frequency-based genetic distance measures were anticipated by Bhattacharyya (1946). Nei and Takezaki (1994) have also studied the effectiveness of several genetic distance measures in the context of phylogenetic analysis, including Bhattacharyya’s distance measure.","tags":["Statistical Genetics"],"title":"Bhattacharyya's distance measure as a precursor of genetic distance measures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chandrika B-Rao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1066435200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609250067,"objectID":"9992c52f10ed9906282a423288d9f008","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/talk/biochemical-network-analysis/","publishdate":"2020-12-29T13:30:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/biochemical-network-analysis/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Biochemical network analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Vineet K Sharma","Chandrika B-Rao","Anu Sharma","Samir K Brahmachari","Srinivasan Ramachandran"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1064966400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609250067,"objectID":"b7b5fe16d12eb2c4beefe71291c62dbe","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/publication/tg-can-repeats-in-human-housekeeping-genes/","publishdate":"2020-12-28T17:10:02+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tg-can-repeats-in-human-housekeeping-genes/","section":"publication","summary":"The unravelling of human genome sequence gives a new opportunity to investigate the role of repetitive sequences in gene regulation.

There are regions such as the four homeobox gene clusters, which are nearly devoid of these repeats that contrast with repeat dense regions in other transcriptionally active regions of the genome. Our analysis of the completely sequenced chromosomes 21 and 22 revealed a striking bias in Alu distribution. These elements are more clustered in genes which are involved in metabolism, transport, and signaling processes. In contrast, they are significantly fewer in genes coding for information pathway components as well as structural proteins. This bias in Alu distribution is independent of the effect of Alu density of the flanking genomic region and is also not affected by the GC content of the gene and its upstream and downstream regions. The relative proportions of Alu subfamilies (Alu J, Alu S, and Alu Y) are not significantly different in genes with high Alu density belonging to the functional categories of transport, metabolism, and signaling. However, in the structural proteins and information genes, these proportions are lower than the other three categories. We suggest that Alu elements might be involved in regulatory mechanisms and are therefore differentially selected in primate genomes.","tags":["Genome Informatics"],"title":"Nonrandom Distribution of Alu Elements in Genes of Various Functional Categories: Insight from Analysis of Human Chromosomes 21 and 22","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chandrika B-Rao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1057708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609250067,"objectID":"affc8609108c7ee0867e3595bdccbd45","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/talk/inverse-analysis-of-biological-networks/","publishdate":"2020-12-29T13:28:42+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/inverse-analysis-of-biological-networks/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Inverse analysis of biological networks","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Tannistha Nandi","Debasis Dash","Rohit Ghai","Chandrika B-Rao","K Kannan","Samir K Brahmachari","C Ramakrishnan","Srinivasan Ramachandran"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1049155200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609250067,"objectID":"766e7a230c690613edeec3c4ff6c38d5","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/publication/a-novel-complexity-measure-for-comparative-analysis-of-protein-sequences-from-complete-genomes/","publishdate":"2020-12-28T17:00:13+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/a-novel-complexity-measure-for-comparative-analysis-of-protein-sequences-from-complete-genomes/","section":"publication","summary":"Analysis of sequence complexities of proteins is an important step in the characterization and classification of new genomes. A new measure has been proposed to compute sequence complexity in protein sequences based on linguistic complexity. The algorithm requires a single parameter, is computationally simple and provides a framework for comparative genomic analysis. Protein sequences were classified into groups of ‘high’ or ‘low complexity’ based on a quantitative measure termed Fc which is proportional to the fraction of low complexity sequence present in the protein. The algorithm was tested on sequences of 196 non-homologous proteins whose crystal structures are available at ≤2.0 Å resolution. Protein sequences of high complexity had ‘globular’ structures (95% agreement), whereas those of low complexity had ‘non-globular’ structures (80% agreement). Application of this measure to proteins of unknown structure/function from different genomes revealed that the sequences of ‘high’ complexity constitute the majority in all genomes (about 90% in Archaea, about 93% in Eubacteria, 89% in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 90% in Caenorhabditis elegans). Aeropyrum pernix among Archaeae and Deinococcus radiodurans among Eubacteria have the lowest fraction of high complexity proteins (75% and 80% respectively). Further, it was observed that a few bacterial pathogens (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) have high fraction of low complexity proteins.

In this paper, for a random sampling scheme, we address two questions: (A) What should be the minimum size of the sample so that, with a prespecified probability, all alleles at a given locus (or haplotypes at a given set of loci) are detected? (B) What should be the sample size so that the allele frequency distribution at a given locus (or haplotype frequency distribution at a given set of loci) is estimated reliably within permissible error limits? Methods: We have used combinatorial probabilistic arguments and Monte Carlo simulations to answer these questions. Results: We found that the minimum sample size required in case A depends mainly on the prespecified probability of detecting all alleles, while in case B, it varies greatly depending on the permissible error in estimation (which will vary with the application). We have obtained the minimum sample sizes for different degrees of polymorphism at a locus under high stringency, as well as a relaxed level of permissible error. We present a detailed sampling procedure for estimating allele frequencies at a given locus, which will be of use in practical applications. Conclusion: Since the sample size required for reliable estimation of allele frequency distribution increases with the number of alleles at the locus, there is a strong case for using biallelic markers (like single nucleotide polymorphisms) when the available sample size is about 800 or less.","tags":[],"title":"Sample Size Considerations in Genetic Polymorphism Studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chandrika B-Rao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":978134400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609250067,"objectID":"5a516b8760d1a4a0fd06a9634e336420","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/talk/sample-size-considerations-in-genetic-polymorphism-studies/","publishdate":"2020-12-29T13:22:10+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/sample-size-considerations-in-genetic-polymorphism-studies/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Sample size considerations in genetic polymorphism studies","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Quasar Saleem","V.S.

There is evidence that these diseases may manifest the phenomenon of anticipation similar to that seen in diseases caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions. A recent report has implicated a potassium channel-coding gene, KCNN3, which contains a polymorphic CAG repeat in its coding region, in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We have tried to confirm these findings in Indian patients suffering from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. No statistically significant evidence for the presence of an excess of longer alleles in the patient population, as compared to ethnically matched controls, was found. However, an analysis of the difference of allele sizes revealed a significantly greater number of patients with schizophrenia having differences of allele sizes  or = 5 when compared to normal controls. This finding may be of functional significance as the KCNN3 protein is thought to act as a tetramer, and a large difference in allele sizes would result in an asymmetric molecule with a different number of glutamine residues in each monomer.

But while it may be the link between these genera at the species level, it is not entirely distinct from Oreochromis at the molecular level. Further, Sarotherodon and Oreochromis species may have arisen from Tilapia in several speciation events. Some of the species interrelations agreed with inferences from morphological data, and disagreed with those from a consensus maximum parsimony (MP) tree. It is suggested that both Chromidotilapia guntheri and Tylochromis jentinki are ancestral to diVerent sub‐groups of Tilapia, so that inferences from morphological studies and the consensus MP method are both partially correct.

We also give directions for future research with a view toward applications.","tags":["Theoretical Immunology"],"title":"Inverse analysis of empirical matrices of idiotypic network interactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chandrika B-Rao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":787276800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609250067,"objectID":"f2c6da58861fc063bb17e57f90d38675","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/talk/map-like-representation-of-dna-fingerprinting-data/","publishdate":"2020-12-29T14:12:20+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/map-like-representation-of-dna-fingerprinting-data/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Map-like representation of DNA fingerprinting data","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Chandrika B-Rao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":734745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609250067,"objectID":"1ab95ae6cf5cb22a13ff09534d1a6ab6","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/talk/b-cell-repertoire-size-in-a-self-assertive-immune-system/","publishdate":"2020-12-29T14:11:11+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/b-cell-repertoire-size-in-a-self-assertive-immune-system/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"B Cell repertoire size in a self-assertive immune system","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Chandrika B-Rao","R R Joshi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":660009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609334353,"objectID":"ac841f889222b97a525b6557b76dcf14","permalink":"https://chandrikabrao.github.io/publication/stochastic-inventory-analysis-of-antibody-production/","publishdate":"2020-12-28T16:28:34+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/stochastic-inventory-analysis-of-antibody-production/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we present a stochastic inventory model for monoclonal antibody maintenance and production during a secondary immune response.
