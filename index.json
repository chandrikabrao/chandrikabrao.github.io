Recently we discovered a novel pyrimidine enzymatic assays. Molecular docking studies showed binding pattern similar to that of febuxostat. Shifting a nitrogen atom in pyrimidine ring (for convenience we will call them 'reverse pyrimidine' analogs), and docking to xanthine oxidase interactions and docking scores for the two chemotypes. However, the reverse pyrimidines showed loss of activity when tested enzymatic assay. As docking studies did not discriminate between the two scaffolds, in an effort to explain this u the enzymatic assay, MMGB-SA binding energy calculations were done on docked complexes. Detailed analysis of various contributing energy terms to deltaG values from MMGB-SA calculations indicated that the 'ligand ~20 kcal/mol between pairs of pyrimidine and corresponding reverse pyrimidine derivatives. Ligand measure of stability of bound ligand to the protein active site. Higher values of this energy term chemotype, when bound in the receptor environment, has unfavorable contacts that may be responsible for the reduced activity compounds. From this study it can be inferred that MMGB studies do not provide expected results.","tags":["computational-drug-discovery"],"title":"Discriminating Between Active and Inactive Compounds Using Binding Energy Calculations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhijit Roychowdhury","Rajiv Sharma","Malcolm Mascarenhas","Chandrika B-Rao","Shashikant M Patil","Sambhaji Chavan","Nitin Lad","Smriti Khanna","Christopher J Dinsmore"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1427846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605737582,"objectID":"19d1d2e03d566b09d63f91c11326e78e","permalink":"https://sukrutrao.github.io/cbr-website-output/publication/insulin-like-growth-factor-1-receptor-inhibitors/","publishdate":"2020-11-18T03:25:56+01:00","relpermalink":"/cbr-website-output/publication/insulin-like-growth-factor-1-receptor-inhibitors/","section":"publication","summary":"The present invention relates to compounds that are capable of inhibiting, modulating and/or regulating Insulin-Like-Growth Factor I Receptor and Insulin Receptor.

They are potent insulin-sensitizing agents but due to adverse effects like hepatotoxicity, a safer alternative of TZDs is highly demanded.

It was unclear whether the side effects observed are target mediated or compound mediated, but most of the TZDs activate PPARγ.
